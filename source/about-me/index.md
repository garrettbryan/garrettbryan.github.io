<h1> BUilding my World with Code and Web Technologies </h1>

I'm a web developer, with project management, data analytics, and operations experience.  My experience in both large and small companies has made me solutions focused. I deliver projects on or before deadlines. I understand the code that I'm working with. I always want to know the high level and the details. Knowing the code well makes me more efficient discussing with, and gathering requirements from stakeholders. I'm always super pumped to be coding and building things.

When I'm not working, I spend lots of time with my two young daughters. You can find us at the kids' museums, hiking, soccer, swimming, or music
