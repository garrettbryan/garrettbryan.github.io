I made a burnout oven for investment casting. The investment casting procedure requires that all investment, either wax or plastic be removed, else major defects, resulting in rejection of the part, occur. ( See my previous posts.)  I tried and failed using my large furnace for burnouts. The heating of the paster mold was not uniform and not slow. It caused too many thermal induced stress fractures.  [![investment_casting56](http://outlyingoutlier.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/investment_casting56.jpg?w=300)](http://outlyingoutlier.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/investment_casting56.jpg) [![investment_casting55](http://outlyingoutlier.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/investment_casting55.jpg?w=300)](http://outlyingoutlier.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/investment_casting55.jpg) The easy melt oven is made from a recycled propane tank and a dishwasher heating element. It is surprisingly effective. A word of  warning, the heating element is not designed to burn out plastic, so there may be issues in the future with heater element failure. \[gallery ids="341,343,342"\] [![Easy Melt Oven](http://outlyingoutlier.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/photo.jpg?w=225)](http://outlyingoutlier.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/photo.jpg) The only tricky bit was to bend the heater element into an appropriate shape. I started by straightening the heater element. From there, I was able to make a simple bending jig.  [![Heater Element Bending Jig](http://outlyingoutlier.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/photo-1.jpg?w=225)](http://outlyingoutlier.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/photo-1.jpg)The element came out great, rather than concentric circles in the plans, I wrapped the element into a into a helix of two turns.

I will be replacing the it with refractory.  It's cleaner and no hazardous fibers. I'll cover the making of the plaster molds in another post.  Here is one of my early unrefined processes. \[gallery ids="273,276,277,278,279"\] Once the plaster has been poured and cured around the part. The burnout process can begin. \[gallery ids="294,298,301,305"\] At 315 degrees Celsius I noticed water dripping from the lip of the easy melt oven. The propane tank acted as a condensation point for the combustion products. The water vapor condensed near the opening. Disappearing condensation was indicative off a complete burnout. \[gallery ids="307,308,309,310,311,314,313,312"\] The multiple plater layer burnout test allowed me to verify that all the PLA plastic was burned out. Here are some more early unrefined investment casting procedures. \[gallery ids="323,324,325,326,327,328,329"\] Here are the pieces sans sprue. \[gallery ids="352,351,350"\] Like every early adopter of 3D printing I have so many prints that failed  for one reason or another.  My casting test used two of these. I used the standard reprap calibration cube and a bolt hobber from thingiverse. I designed a fin test to determine minimum casting thickness, but it broke in the early burnout attempts.

Another interesting use of the Easy Melt Oven is as a mold preheater.  So I will definitely see how the mold temperature affects the depth of the fins.
