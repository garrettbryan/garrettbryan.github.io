I'm experimenting with a failed incomplete 3D print. My thought was that the molten Aluminum would have enough internal energy to melt or burn out the plastic. I knew this would generate gas so I added vent holes. Even though I knew a thermodynamic analysis would have answered my question, I kinda wanted to just pour molten metal on PLA and see what would happen. \[slideshow\]
