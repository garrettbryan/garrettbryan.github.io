I needed a pneumatic match plate vibrator ([stl](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:26315)) for my future castings. So working from the plans from Steve Chastain's [awesome book](http://stephenchastain.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=1&products_id=6), I created this:

The first day I flipped the pattern and core print, so that the core print was in the cope. Well needless to say the sand mold was ruined at that point. The next day I remade the molds correctly, only taking pictures to fill in the sequence's gaps. \[slideshow\] Now I just have to clean up the casting, drill a few holes, and get a steel bearing for the rotating weight. Here's what a "[professional](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&tbm=shop&sclient=psy-ab&q=pneumatic+vibrator&oq=pneumatic+vibrator&gs_l=serp.3...4721.6824.10.8162.9.9.0.0.0.0.106.745.8j1.9.0...0.0.HotH7laIldU&pbx=1&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&fp=ecd0620c0a53f36f&biw=1125&bih=894)" match plate vibrator can cost.
